# Use case: ESG / Supply-Chain Due Diligence (CSDDD + CSRD + 12 jurisdictions)

## What this answers

> "We need to audit our deep-tier supplier networks (tier 3 and tier

> S-211, Australia MSA, and Japan METI Guidelines - without hiring
> 100 more ESG analysts. AND we need to share rogue-broker / rogue-

## How tier 3 / tier 4+ traversal works

`pipeline/deep-tier-supplier-audit` uses `processor/iterative-revise-loop`
as the outer agent:

1. **Iter 1**: Resolve T1 supplier → grade T1 → expand T1's known T2 set.
2. **Iter 2**: For each T2, grade → expand T3 set.
3. **Iter N**: Grade T(N-1) → expand T(N) set. **Surface audit_gaps**
   when a tier cannot be resolved (typical at T ≥ 3 - most factories
   in Asia subcontract through informal labor agencies whose books
   don't surface in the lead supplier registry).
4. **Termination**: max_depth reached OR every leaf resolved.
5. **Aggregation**: `processor/multi-vector-fusion` rolls up per-tier
   findings into a chain-wide compliance report.
6. **Escalation**: `processor/escalate-human-review` routes any
   high-severity finding to the compliance team.

## Cross-organization knowledge sharing (without breaching confidentiality)

`pipeline/anonymized-illicit-recruitment-pattern-sharing` implements a
k-anonymity + HMAC scheme:

1. Each org's findings → `processor/redact-pii-text` (worker names
   stripped).
2. Broker IDs → HMACed with hub-published salt (so same broker
   produces same hash everywhere, but the hash is not invertible).
3. Bucketed by `(broker_hash, corridor, indicator_category,
   90-day-window)`.
4. Buckets with `count < k` (default k = 5) are dropped - small
   buckets could be re-identified back to the source org.
5. Surviving buckets are signed and published.
6. Member orgs query: "have these indicators been seen against this
   broker / corridor?" → returns aggregate count + severity, never
   per-org provenance.

Inspired by FATF Recommendation 18 info-sharing principles, adapted
to the ESG / forced-labor context. The k threshold is a tunable
trade-off: higher k = stronger anonymity, weaker signal; lower k =
faster pattern surfacing, more re-identification risk.

## Evidence the GREP rules work (live test, 2026-05-19)

Run `python3 scripts/run_esg_grep.py` against the 3 synthetic samples
in `data/supplier-disclosure-samples/` - output:

```
=== sample-T1-tech-supplier-good.json ===
  S (forced-labor): no hits
  E (environmental): no hits
  G (governance): no hits

=== sample-T2-agri-paraguay-mixed.json ===
  E (environmental): 2 rules fired
     high     : land_clearing_legacy, near_protected_area

=== sample-T3-textile-mae-sot-flagged.json ===
  S (forced-labor): 8 rules fired
     critical : passport_retention, restricted_movement_dormitory
     high     : recruitment_fee_abuse, wage_withholding,
                isolation_unfree_communication, abusive_overtime_consent
     medium   : excessive_overtime, audit_gap_tier_3_4
  E (environmental): 1 rules fired
     critical : untreated_dye_effluent
  G (governance): 1 rules fired
     high     : beneficial_ownership_opaque

=== headline ===
  T1-good                            C: 0  H: 0  M: 0  L: 0  (correctly clean)
  T2-mixed                           C: 0  H: 2  M: 0  L: 0  (deforestation legacy + KBA)
  T3-Mae-Sot-flagged                 C: 3  H: 5  M: 2  L: 0  (10 hits, all expected)
```

Captured findings JSON at `data/esg-grep-findings.json`. The rules
correctly:
1. Stay silent on the well-disclosed T1 supplier (zero false positives).
2. Surface 2 high-severity environmental flags on the Paraguay T2 soy
   supplier (legacy land clearing + protected-area proximity).
3. Detect 10 indicators across all 3 ESG dimensions on the T3 Mae
   Sot textile workshop, including all 3 critical-severity rules
   expected: passport retention, dormitory movement restriction,
   untreated dye effluent.

The `processor/structured-to-prose` step (added 2026-05-19 after the
first test exposed false negatives on structured JSON) flattens the
supplier disclosure into prose lines before GREP - this is what
makes structured red-flag detection work.

## What this is NOT

- A legal opinion. Real CSDDD compliance requires jurisdiction-
  specific legal sign-off, BSA-officer-equivalent review, and CSDDD
  Art. 26 board-level oversight.
- A determination of forced labor. The pipeline produces RISK FLAGS
  with citations. The lead company's compliance officer makes the
  determination after the supplier's right of reply (CSDDD Art. 10).
- A substitute for on-the-ground audits at high-risk tiers - those
  remain mandatory under CSDDD risk-based due diligence.
