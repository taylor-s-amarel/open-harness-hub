## Going broader - methodology

For each future use case, the recipe should answer:

1. **Goal** (one sentence)
2. **Inputs** + **outputs** (typed)
3. **Primary pipeline** (existing or planned slug)
4. **Primitives used** (table mapping each layer to an artifact in the catalog)
5. **Composition diagram** (the persona → grep → rag → tool → harness chain)
6. **Sample inputs / outputs**
7. **Install path** (Claude Code marketplace command, direct skill drop, or run-pipeline command)
8. **Customization knobs**
9. **Verifier / rubric** (which `rubric/*` to use as success criterion)
10. **Known risks / gotchas**

When all 38+ recipes are written, the use-cases section becomes the
"recipes" answer to "what can I build with this hub?"
