# Lead-company code-of-conduct stub (placeholder)

<!-- Generated from Open Harness Hub manifest `knowledge-pack/lead-company-code-stub` v0.1.0. Edit the source manifest and re-run `python scripts/emit/hf_dataset_card.py`. -->

## Dataset description

Placeholder reference that ESG / vendor pipelines accept as the
lead-company-specific code of conduct. Real instances would replace
this with the deploying organization's actual code (a vendor-
required policy artifact).

Ships with one composite example entry — enough for pipelines to
pass validation in synthetic-demo mode without exposing a real
company's policy.

**Industries**: cross_industry, esg, supply_chain, compliance
**Capabilities**: retrieval
**Modalities**: text
**Freshness**: stable
**Trust boundary**: local
