# Open Harness Hub — Playground

Pick any pipeline from the [Open Harness Hub](https://github.com/TaylorAmarelTech/open-harness-hub)
catalog, plug in sample data, and watch the DAG execute step-by-step.
This Space reads pipelines directly from the catalog at runtime.

## Catalog state

Snapshot at last Space build (auto-updated by CI):

- **adapter**: 17
- **benchmark**: 1
- **dataset**: 36
- **harness**: 13
- **knowledge-pack**: 56
- **pattern**: 49
- **persona**: 51
- **pipeline**: 108
- **processor**: 60
- **rubric**: 45
- **rule-pack**: 55
- **tool**: 14

**Total artifacts**: 505.

## Run locally

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python app.py
# open http://127.0.0.1:7860
```

## Switching the model

The app honors:

- `OH_MODEL` (default `simulated`; set to `ollama/llama3.1:8b` or any
  OpenAI-compatible endpoint).
- `OPENAI_API_KEY` for OpenAI-compatible adapters.
- `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` for the Anthropic judge.

Without a model configured, the app runs in **simulate mode**: every
harness/tool step returns a stub so you still see the shape of the
trace.

## Adding a new pipeline

Open a PR against the main repo with a new manifest under
`catalog/pipelines/...`. After it merges, CI rebuilds this Space and
the pipeline appears in the dropdown automatically.
