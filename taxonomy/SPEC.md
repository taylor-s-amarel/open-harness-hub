# Open Harness Hub — Taxonomy Specification

> Version: 0.1.0
> Status: Draft for public review
> Audience: Authors of harness/pipeline/benchmark catalogs

This document defines the controlled vocabulary, artifact types, and
manifest fields used by the Open Harness Hub. Every entry in `catalog/`
must conform to one of the artifact schemas in `schemas/`.

The taxonomy is industry-agnostic. Industry-specific terms (e.g.
*corridor profile*, *medical-coding rule*, *financial-crime indicator*) are
modeled as **leaf instances** of generic types, not as new top-level
categories.

---

## 1. Layers and primitives

The hub describes AI systems at four layers. Lower layers are the
building blocks of higher layers.

```
Layer 4 — Benchmarks & Evaluations
              ▲
Layer 3 — Pipelines (compositions of harnesses + rules + tools)
              ▲
Layer 2 — Harnesses (named workflows around a model or trust boundary)
              ▲
Layer 1 — Knowledge packs · Logic packs · Rule packs · Tools · Personas · Adapters · Schemas
```

Cross-cutting: **Datasets** can live at any layer; **Rubrics** are logic
packs but get their own top-level catalog because they are central to
evaluation; **Adapters** are how a harness talks to a model.

### 1.1 Knowledge pack

A typed bundle of *facts*. Read by harnesses; never holds logic.

Examples: a RAG corpus of statutes; a directory of NGO hotlines; a table
of fee caps by jurisdiction; a citation graph; a glossary; a contact pack.

Files: a `manifest.yaml` plus one or more typed data files
(`*.jsonl`, `*.yaml`, `*.csv`, `*.md`).

### 1.2 Logic pack

A typed bundle of *behavior*. Read by harnesses; never holds facts.

Examples: a persona system prompt; a tool registry; a response schema;
a refusal-style policy; a rubric definition; a prompt template family.

### 1.3 Rule pack

A modular bundle of one **rule family**. A rule pack is a kind of logic
pack with a known schema.

| Family | Identifier | Shape |
|---|---|---|
| GREP | `grep` | List of `(id, pattern, severity, category, fires_what)` regex rules. |
| Glob | `glob` | List of `(id, pattern, applies_to)` filepath/text patterns. |
| Classifier | `classifier` | List of `(id, label, examples, threshold)` rules used by lightweight classifiers. |
| Heuristic | `heuristic` | List of `(id, condition, action)` deterministic decisions. |
| RAG | `rag` | A corpus + index spec + retrieval policy (`bm25`, `dense`, `rrf`). |
| Citation | `citation` | A graph of citation edges between RAG documents. |
| Online search | `online_search` | Allowlist/blocklist/per-source policy + sanitization + freshness window for outbound web search. |
| PII / privacy | `privacy` | Detection patterns + redaction recipes. |
| Schema | `schema` | JSON Schemas / Pydantic equivalents enforced at I/O boundaries. |
| Routing | `routing` | Conditional dispatch — which harness should handle which input. |

A rule pack is identified by `(family, slug, version)`. New families can be
proposed; the hub keeps the family list small and documented.

### 1.4 Tool

A **function-call** definition usable by any model that supports tool use.

A tool manifest declares:

- `name`, `description`, `parameters` (JSON Schema)
- `returns` (JSON Schema)
- `side_effects` (none | read | write | external_call)
- `trust_boundary` (local | hub | external)
- `examples` (golden input/output pairs)
- `implementations` (zero or more references — Python callable path, HTTP
  endpoint spec, shell command, MCP server, OpenAPI op, etc.)

A tool can exist without an implementation; it then describes a contract
others can implement.

### 1.5 Persona

A character or role frame the model adopts at the start of a workflow.
Personas are logic packs with a constrained schema:

- `system_prompt` (markdown)
- `role`, `domain`, `tone`, `refusal_style`
- `extends` (optional — inherit from a base persona)

### 1.6 Model adapter

A **provider-neutral transport** for talking to a model. Adapter manifests
declare:

- `transport`: `none` · `callable` · `transformers` · `unsloth` ·
  `llama_cpp` · `ollama` · `openai_compatible` · `anthropic` ·
  `google_gemini` · `hf_inference_endpoint` · `frontier_api` ·
  `gemma_runtime` · `local_only`
- `capabilities`: `text_generation` · `chat` · `tool_use` ·
  `vision_in` · `audio_in` · `audio_out` · `structured_json` ·
  `embedding`
- `auth`: `none` · `api_key` · `oauth` · `local_only` · `byok`
- `cost_model`: `free` · `freemium` · `paid` · `self_hosted`
- `trust_boundary`: `local` · `hub` · `external`

Adapters are the bridge to actual provider catalogs. The hub does not
itself maintain provider lists — it points to external directories
(see `examples/llm-endpoint-directory/`).

### 1.7 Harness

A **named, repeatable workflow** around a model or a trust boundary.
Harnesses are the heart of the hub. Each harness manifest declares the
full `HarnessSpec` (see §3.1).

A harness wraps one or more model calls (or zero — pure deterministic
gates count). It composes rule packs into **applied layers**, declares
which **knowledge object types** it consumes and emits, and states its
**privacy boundaries**.

### 1.8 Pipeline

A **directed acyclic graph** (DAG) of harness invocations, rule pack
calls, and tool calls that completes one specific task.

A pipeline manifest declares:

- `task` (a one-sentence goal — "classify a job offer's risk level",
  "draft a complaint packet from chat transcripts", "summarize a
  technical paper for a non-expert reader", "generate a cinematic
  product photo with brand-safe guard rules")
- `pipeline_kind` — see §11 for the open vocabulary
  (`research_entity`, `verify_data`, `format_response`,
  `classify`, `extract`, `summarize`, `translate`,
  `generate_text`, `generate_image`, `generate_audio`,
  `generate_video`, `route`, `evaluate`, `redact`, `agent_loop`, …)
- `inputs`, `outputs` (typed)
- `steps`: ordered list of `{kind, ref, when, on_error}` where `kind` is
  `harness | rule_pack | tool | adapter | branch | loop`
- `defaults`: persona, model adapter, knowledge packs, rule packs
- `success_criteria`: rubric refs + numeric thresholds

A pipeline is comparable across runs — different model adapters or rule
packs yield different scores under the same rubric.

### 1.9 Benchmark

A **pipeline run against a labeled test set with a rubric**, producing
a comparable score. A benchmark manifest declares:

- `pipeline` (ref)
- `dataset` (ref) — test set
- `rubric` (ref)
- `judge`: `deterministic` | `local_model` | `frontier_judge` | `human`
- `model_arms`: list of `{adapter_ref, label}` to compare side-by-side
- `headline_metric`: a single number readers should look at
- `reproducibility`: `(commit_sha, dataset_version, run_date)`

### 1.10 Rubric

An **evaluation contract**. Each rubric manifest declares:

- `dimensions`: list of `{id, label, weight, scale, evidence_required}`
- `scoring_method`: `weighted_sum` | `min` | `gating` | `custom`
- `examples`: golden examples for each grade band

### 1.11 Dataset

A typed collection of inputs, outputs, and labels. Datasets carry
**provenance** chains (source, scrape date, license, anonymization
status). They can be used as test sets, training sets, or knowledge
sources.

### 1.12 Schema

A typed I/O contract referenced by multiple artifacts. Schemas live in
`catalog/schemas/` and are referenced by `$ref` from manifests.

---

## 2. Controlled vocabularies (cross-cutting axes)

Every artifact is tagged with values from these vocabularies. Each is
defined in `vocabularies/<name>.yaml`.

### 2.1 Industry

Open vocabulary. Suggested top-level industries (one or many per
artifact):

`healthcare` · `finance` · `legal` · `education` · `government` ·
`retail` · `manufacturing` · `media` · `security` · `climate` ·
`agriculture` · `energy` · `transportation` · `real_estate` ·
`hospitality` · `nonprofit` · `defense` · `humanitarian` ·
`scientific_research` · `software` · `creative` · `personal_productivity`

A sub-vocabulary can be added per industry (e.g. `healthcare.radiology`,
`finance.aml`, `legal.immigration`).

### 2.2 Capability

What the artifact does, in user-facing terms:

`classification` · `extraction` · `retrieval` · `summarization` ·
`generation` · `translation` · `reasoning` · `planning` · `evaluation` ·
`anonymization` · `routing` · `verification` · `tool_use` · `dialogue` ·
`memory` · `safety_gating`

### 2.3 Modality

`text` · `image` · `audio` · `video` · `code` · `structured` · `tabular`

### 2.4 Trust boundary

`local` — the artifact stays on the user's machine.
`hub` — content is synced to the public hub (no raw PII).
`external` — the artifact calls a third party.

### 2.5 Lifecycle

`experimental` · `beta` · `stable` · `deprecated`

### 2.6 Freshness

`stable` — facts rarely change.
`volatile` — facts change often; bind via tool calls, not training.
`dated` — facts true as of a specific date; recheck after that date.

### 2.7 License

SPDX identifiers. Suggested defaults: `MIT`, `Apache-2.0`, `CC-BY-4.0`,
`CC-BY-SA-4.0`, `CC0-1.0`, `Proprietary`.

## 3. Manifest fields

Every manifest starts with the common envelope, then adds artifact-type
fields.

## 4. Knowledge-object leaf types (open vocabulary)

Harnesses declare which knowledge-object **leaf types** they consume and
emit. Leaf types are the typed slices of a knowledge pack. The hub keeps
a registry of leaf types in `vocabularies/leaf-types.yaml`; new types
are added by PR.

Suggested baseline leaf types (industry-agnostic):

`grep_rule` · `glob_rule` · `classifier_rule` · `heuristic_rule` ·
`rag_doc` · `citation_edge` · `persona_block` · `context_snippet` ·
`reasoning_step` · `rubric_dimension` · `tool_definition` ·
`tool_example` · `prompt_template` · `fact_template` ·
`extracted_fact` · `entity_signal` · `envelope_schema` ·
`submission_schema` · `upload_schema` · `audit_template` ·
`response_policy`

Industry-specific examples (modeled as instances of `entity_signal` /
`fact_template` / `corridor_profile`, **not** as new top-level types):

| Industry | Leaf instance | Generic parent |
|---|---|---|
| humanitarian | `corridor_profile` | `entity_signal` |
| humanitarian | `ngo_directory` | `contact_directory` |
| healthcare | `differential_diagnosis_pattern` | `classifier_rule` |
| healthcare | `medication_interaction_edge` | `citation_edge` |
| finance | `aml_typology` | `classifier_rule` |
| finance | `sanction_list_entry` | `entity_signal` |
| legal | `statute_section` | `rag_doc` |
| legal | `case_citation_edge` | `citation_edge` |
| security | `cve_signature` | `grep_rule` |
| security | `indicator_of_compromise` | `entity_signal` |

The hub stays generic. Industry packs extend the leaf-type vocabulary
through their own manifests.

---

## 5. Composability rules

1. **A pipeline never wires raw rule packs to a model.** A rule pack
   reaches a model through a harness; this keeps the trust boundary
   explicit and auditable.
2. **Volatile facts go in tools or knowledge packs, not personas.**
   Hotline numbers, fee caps, current advisories must be fetched at
   run time. Personas describe *style*, not *facts*.
3. **Every harness declares `model_targets`, even when the value is
   `none`.** Pure deterministic gates make this explicit so auditors
   can grep for them.
4. **Privacy boundaries travel with the artifact, not the deployment.**
   A `local`-boundary harness used inside an `external`-boundary
   pipeline must still keep its raw input local.
5. **Reproducibility is a first-class field.** Every benchmark manifest
   declares `(commit_sha, dataset_version, run_date)`; without it the
   run is research-only, not a citable benchmark.

---

## 6. Lifecycle

| Stage | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `experimental` | One author, no review, no production use. |
| `beta` | At least one external review; documented gaps. |
| `stable` | Used in production; semver-stable manifest. |
| `deprecated` | Superseded by another artifact; kept for citation. |

A `deprecated` artifact must declare `superseded_by` and `deprecated_on`.

---

## 7. Naming and IDs

- Artifact IDs are `{type}/{slug}` where `slug` is lowercase-with-dashes.
- `slug` must be ≤ 64 characters.
- `id` is immutable once published; renames create a new ID with the
  old one marked `deprecated`.
- File names match the slug: `catalog/harnesses/text-safety-review.yaml`.

---

## 8. Versioning

- Artifacts use semver.
- Patch version changes for typos, doc clarifications, additional examples.
- Minor version changes for new optional fields, new manifest entries.
- Major version changes for breaking schema changes — and only after
  a 30-day deprecation window with `superseded_by` set on the old major.

---

## 9. Validation

Every manifest must pass `python scripts/validate.py`. Validation checks:

1. Manifest validates against `schemas/{type}.schema.json`.
2. All `ref` fields point to existing artifacts in the catalog.
3. Knowledge / logic / rule pack leaf types are in the leaf-type vocabulary.
4. Industry / capability / modality tags are in their vocabularies.
5. License is a valid SPDX identifier or `Proprietary`.
6. Privacy-boundary fields are present on every artifact that crosses
   a network boundary.

A pipeline manifest additionally checks the DAG — no cycles, no missing
step refs, no dangling outputs.

---

## 10. Multimodal pipelines

Image, audio, and video pipelines compose the **same** primitives as
text pipelines. The hub does not split modalities into separate trees.

A common image-generation pipeline looks like:

```
[persona]   "Brand-safe product photographer"
[rule_pack] "grep-prohibited-terms" — rejects real-celebrity names, hate slurs, trademark prompts
[rule_pack] "rag-style-references"   — retrieves cinematic-lighting style descriptors
[rule_pack] "rag-camera-physics"     — retrieves lens / focal-length physical priors
[harness]   "prompt-shaper"          — composes the raw user idea + retrieved style + rules into a final prompt
[tool]      "txt2img.sdxl"           — function-call to the image model
[harness]   "result-safety-review"   — runs NSFW / IP / brand-mark detectors on the output image
[rule_pack] "grep-output-watermark"  — verifies brand-safe watermark presence
```

Every step uses the same manifest types as a text pipeline. The only
new vocabulary is the output `modality: ["image"]` and the
`pipeline_kind: "generate_image"`.

Audio (TTS / music / SFX) and video (txt2video / video editing)
pipelines follow the identical pattern with the appropriate
`modality`, `pipeline_kind`, and tool refs.

### Image-gen pipeline checklist (recommended fields)

When a pipeline emits image / audio / video, the manifest should also
declare:

- `output_safety_packs`: rule packs that screen the generated artifact
  (NSFW, IP, watermark presence, prompt-injection-via-image, etc.).
- `style_packs`: knowledge packs of style references the prompt-shaper
  pulls from.
- `physics_packs`: knowledge packs encoding physical priors
  (lens / aperture / lighting / acoustic / motion physics).
- `attribution`: a free-text field describing who / what the style
  references are drawn from, plus the dataset license they came from.

---

## 11. Suggested pipeline catalog categories

The catalog ships with subdirectories under `catalog/pipelines/` that
mirror the most-requested **pipeline kinds**. Each is a normal pipeline
manifest; the subdirectory is purely an organizational hint for browsing.

| Subdir | Pipeline kind | Example task |
|---|---|---|
| `research-entity/` | `research_entity` | "Build a sourced one-page profile of a company / person / place." |
| `verify-data/` | `verify_data` | "Given a claim and a corpus, return supports / contradicts / no-evidence with citations." |
| `format-response/` | `format_response` | "Convert raw model output into a strict JSON envelope; auto-repair." |
| `classify/` | `classify` | "Tag a record into a controlled label set with confidence." |
| `extract/` | `extract` | "Pull typed fields from unstructured text / PDF / image." |
| `summarize/` | `summarize` | "Produce a 200-word executive summary with citations." |
| `translate/` | `translate` | "Translate with terminology guard rules + glossary RAG." |
| `redact/` | `redact` | "PII / secrets / proprietary-mark redaction with audit log." |
| `route/` | `route` | "Dispatch incoming input to the right downstream pipeline." |
| `agent-loop/` | `agent_loop` | "Plan + tool-call + verify + reflect in a loop until done." |
| `evaluate/` | `evaluate` | "Run a rubric over an artifact and return a graded score." |
| `system-prompt-library/` | `system_prompt` | "Reusable system-prompt + persona starter for common roles." |
| `rag-library/` | `rag_pack` | "Curated RAG packs (statutes, glossaries, style refs, physics)." |
| `grep-library/` | `grep_pack` | "Curated GREP rule packs (PII, NSFW, brand-safety, fraud)." |
| `tool-library/` | `tool_pack` | "Function-call schemas, MCP servers, OpenAPI ops." |
| `generate-text/` | `generate_text` | "Free-form text generation with a defined harness." |
| `generate-image/` | `generate_image` | "Image gen with prompt-shaping, style RAG, guard rules, output safety." |
| `generate-audio/` | `generate_audio` | "Speech / music / SFX gen with the same primitive stack." |
| `generate-video/` | `generate_video` | "Video gen / editing pipelines with motion-physics RAG." |
| `multimodal/` | `multimodal_*` | "Pipelines that cross modalities (e.g., image + text + audio)." |

These categories are **suggestions, not constraints**. Any pipeline can
live in any subdir; the canonical key is the `pipeline_kind` field in
the manifest.

## 12. Ingest paths

The catalog grows from three ingest paths:

1. **Direct contributions.** A contributor opens a PR adding one or
   more manifests under `catalog/`. CI runs schema validation, ref
   resolution, and lint.
2. **Reference repos.** Curators import patterns from established
   reference repos (such as `_reference/gemma4_comp` and
   `_reference/llm-safety-framework`) by hand-extracting the harness /
   knowledge-pack / pipeline shape and writing a manifest that
   attributes the source.
3. **Kaggle harness mining.** A scheduled script (see
   `scripts/mine_kaggle_harnesses.py`) crawls Kaggle competition notebooks
   and linked GitHub repos, detects harness / RAG / GREP / tool / pipeline
   patterns, and emits **draft manifests under `catalog/_inbox/`** for
   curator review. The mining script:

   - uses Kaggle public metadata (kernels list, competition list,
     dataset list) via the Kaggle API;
   - filters to LLM-relevant competitions (Gemma family, LMSYS,
     reasoning challenges, RAG / retrieval challenges, agent
     hackathons, image-gen competitions, etc.);
   - downloads the kernel script bodies;
   - applies a detector pack (a `rule_pack/grep` + `rule_pack/classifier`
     in this very catalog) that identifies harness-shaped code: any
     wrapper around an LLM call that adds preprocessing, RAG,
     tool-calling, output post-processing, or evaluation;
   - extracts the wrapper into a draft `harness` manifest, the
     reusable rules into a draft `rule_pack`, and the orchestration
     into a draft `pipeline`;
   - records `attribution.source_url`, `attribution.author`,
     `attribution.license` and skips kernels whose license is not
     compatible with redistribution;
   - emits everything to `catalog/_inbox/{date}-{kernel_id}/` for human
     review before promotion to `catalog/{type}/`.

Curators are encouraged to file an issue describing a target pattern
*before* writing the detector, so the mining is purposeful (e.g.,
"find every RAG-with-citation-graph notebook in 2025-2026 retrieval
competitions"). The same script can later target Hugging Face Spaces,
GitHub topic searches, and arXiv code links.

The mining manifest format and detector pack are defined in
`docs/howto/mine-kaggle-harnesses.md`.

## 13. Database representations

Every artifact described by this taxonomy can be **persisted** in four
representative database shapes. Each shape is a published standard with
example DDL / collection spec in `db/`. Implementers pick one — the
manifest stays the same.

### 13.1 Relational (PostgreSQL / SQLite)

A relational mapping with one row per artifact and a small number of
join tables for the array fields. Canonical DDL:

```sql
CREATE TABLE artifact (
  id              TEXT PRIMARY KEY,            -- "harness/text-safety-review"
  type            TEXT NOT NULL,
  version         TEXT NOT NULL,
  name            TEXT NOT NULL,
  description     TEXT NOT NULL,
  license         TEXT NOT NULL,
  lifecycle       TEXT NOT NULL,
  trust_boundary  TEXT,
  freshness       TEXT,
  created         DATE,
  updated         DATE,
  body            JSONB NOT NULL               -- full manifest
);

CREATE TABLE artifact_industry   (artifact_id TEXT REFERENCES artifact(id), industry  TEXT, PRIMARY KEY(artifact_id, industry));
CREATE TABLE artifact_capability (artifact_id TEXT REFERENCES artifact(id), capability TEXT, PRIMARY KEY(artifact_id, capability));
CREATE TABLE artifact_modality   (artifact_id TEXT REFERENCES artifact(id), modality  TEXT, PRIMARY KEY(artifact_id, modality));
CREATE TABLE artifact_tag        (artifact_id TEXT REFERENCES artifact(id), tag       TEXT, PRIMARY KEY(artifact_id, tag));

CREATE TABLE artifact_ref (
  src_id TEXT REFERENCES artifact(id),
  dst_id TEXT REFERENCES artifact(id),
  role   TEXT NOT NULL,                         -- "consumes" | "emits" | "step_ref" | "contributes_to" | "model_target" | "rubric" | "dataset" | ...
  PRIMARY KEY(src_id, dst_id, role)
);
```

This single shape covers all artifact types because the type-specific
fields live in `body` (JSONB). Indexes on `(type, industry, capability)`
make catalog browse queries fast.

### 13.2 Document store (MongoDB / Couchbase / Firestore)

One collection per artifact `type`, one document per artifact, with
the full manifest as the document body. The `attribution`, `links`,
and array fields are nested freely. The `id` field is the document
key. A `refs` array materializes the inbound/outbound edges for
graph-style queries.

### 13.3 Key-value (Redis / DynamoDB)

Used for runtime caches, not as authoritative storage. Suggested keys:

```
artifact:<id>                                 -> manifest JSON
artifact:by_type:<type>                       -> set of ids
artifact:by_industry:<industry>               -> set of ids
artifact:by_capability:<capability>           -> set of ids
artifact:by_tag:<tag>                         -> set of ids
run:<run_id>                                  -> JSON of a pipeline run
run:by_pipeline:<pipeline_id>                 -> sorted set of run ids by ts
```

### 13.4 Vector database (Pinecone / Weaviate / Qdrant / pgvector)

Used for RAG packs and for semantic search across the catalog itself.
Each artifact gets at least one embedding of its `name + description`
for catalog search. Knowledge-pack chunks each get an embedding for
retrieval. Suggested per-vector metadata:

```
{
  "artifact_id":   "knowledge-pack/style-references-cinematic",
  "leaf_type":     "style_reference",
  "chunk_id":      "moody-noir",
  "industry":      ["creative"],
  "modality":      ["text"],
  "trust_boundary": "local",
  "lifecycle":     "experimental"
}
```

### 13.5 Row format for individual rules and knowledge leaves

Beyond the artifact-level table, the **leaves** inside rule packs and
knowledge packs follow a small fixed row shape so they are queryable
across packs:

```sql
CREATE TABLE rule (
  rule_id      TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
  pack_id      TEXT NOT NULL REFERENCES artifact(id),
  family       TEXT NOT NULL,                  -- grep | glob | classifier | heuristic | privacy | online_search | ...
  severity     TEXT,
  category     TEXT,
  pattern      TEXT,                            -- regex / glob / condition / dsl
  body         JSONB NOT NULL,                  -- full rule
  enabled      BOOLEAN DEFAULT TRUE
);

CREATE TABLE knowledge_leaf (
  leaf_id      TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
  pack_id      TEXT NOT NULL REFERENCES artifact(id),
  leaf_type    TEXT NOT NULL,
  industry     TEXT,
  language     TEXT,
  body         JSONB NOT NULL
);
```

This row format is what a SOC analyst, a fact-checker, or a fine-tuning
data engineer would actually query against — "give me every `grep_rule`
of severity `critical` in the `privacy.*` category", "give me every
`rag_doc` in the `humanitarian.trafficking` industry."

The mapping from manifest → relational rows is implemented by
`scripts/db/load_postgres.py` (and equivalents per backend). The
canonical DDL lives in `db/postgres/schema.sql`.

---

## 14. Interactive playground

Pipelines must be **viewable** and **runnable** with sample data so
visitors can build intuition before installing anything. The catalog
supports three levels of interactivity:

1. **Static catalog page (always available).** The MkDocs site renders
   each manifest as a browsable page with: description, primitives it
   consumes, primitives it emits, a step-by-step diagram, and an
   embedded sample-run output. No execution; safe on GitHub Pages.
2. **Pre-rendered sample run (always available).** Each pipeline ships
   with one or more `samples/<scenario>.json` files: a frozen input,
   the deterministic outputs of each step, and the final output. These
   are committed to git and rendered inline on the static page.
3. **Live playground (where the host allows execution).** A Gradio app
   under `hf-space/` loads a pipeline manifest, accepts user input,
   runs the pipeline against a configured model adapter, and shows the
   layer-by-layer trace. The same app works locally
   (`python hf-space/app.py`) and deploys to Hugging Face Spaces or
   any Docker host.

### Sample-run format

```json
{
  "pipeline":   "pipeline/research-entity",
  "scenario":   "company-acme",
  "inputs":    { "entity_name": "Acme Corp", "entity_kind": "company", "country": "US" },
  "steps": [
    {
      "step_id": "redact_query",
      "harness": "harness/redact-pii-text",
      "input":   { "text": "Acme Corp" },
      "output":  { "redacted_text": "Acme Corp", "audit": [] },
      "ms":      4
    }
  ],
  "output":    { "profile_markdown": "...", "citations": [], "trace": [] },
  "model":     "ollama/llama3.1:8b",
  "frozen_at": "2026-05-19T12:00:00Z",
  "license":   "MIT"
}
```

A pipeline with no sample-run committed cannot be marked `stable`. The
validator enforces this rule in §9.

---

## 15. Lifecycle position (pre-API / API / post-API)

Every artifact also declares **where in the request lifecycle it sits**.
This is independent of `lifecycle` (which is maturity:
experimental → stable → deprecated). The two answer different questions.

```
pre_api ── pre_api.input_gating       PII redact, guard rules, prohibited terms
        ├─ pre_api.context_assembly   personas, RAG, prompt templates, knowledge packs
        ├─ pre_api.classification     red-flag screens, typology pre-scoring, routing
        └─ pre_api.query_sanitization outbound search query rewrite, allowlists

api     ── api.model_call             harness + adapter wrapping the model call
        └─ api.tool_call              function-call tools invoked by the model

post_api─ post_api.output_safety      NSFW / IP / watermark / citation-coverage screens
        ├─ post_api.format_coercion   JSON repair, schema validation
        ├─ post_api.evaluation        rubrics, judges, scoring
        └─ post_api.audit             trace formatting, audit-log emission

cross_cutting
        ├─ cross_cutting.composition  pipelines
        ├─ cross_cutting.evaluation   benchmarks
        └─ cross_cutting.data         datasets, schemas
```

The field is **optional on the manifest** — `scripts/build_catalog_index.py`
derives it from type + family + name when omitted, using the rules in
the script's `derive_position()` function. Manifests should declare it
explicitly when the derived value would be ambiguous (for example,
a rule pack that screens both input and output, or a harness that runs
purely as a deterministic gate).

This label powers the static catalog browser
(`docs/catalog/browser.html`) and the vector index
(`db/vector/oh_catalog.jsonl`) so artifacts can be filtered by where
they fit in a pipeline.

---

## 16. Comprehensive pre/post-API process taxonomy

The pipeline lifecycle has many more steps than just "redact, retrieve,
call, evaluate." The hub recognises a comprehensive set of **process**
categories — repeatable, callable transformations with declared I/O —
that may appear at any pipeline stage. Each is an OPEN vocabulary value
for `processor.process_kind` and an allowed value for
`pipeline.steps[].kind`. The full list is at
`docs/concepts/pre-post-api.md`. Highlights:

- **pre_api**: format_convert (PDF/audio/image/HTML/docx → text),
  normalize, validate, redact (PII/PHI/financial/secrets), gate
  (prompt-injection/quota/cost-ceiling), classify (intent/risk/language
  /domain/red_flag), route (dispatch/fallback-chain), assemble
  (persona/prompt-template/few-shot/context-pack/tool-registry/structured
  -output-spec), retrieve (bm25/dense/hybrid/multi-query/citation-graph
  /knowledge-graph), rerank, memory.read, query (rewrite/sanitize
  /allowlist/timebox), policy (identity/permission/consent/licensing).
- **api**: call.chat / stream / tool_use / batch / embedding / vision
  / audio_in / audio_out / image_out / video_out / judge.
- **post_api**: parse (tool_calls/json/citations/usage/uncertainty),
  coerce (json_repair/schema_validate/constrained_grammar/length
  /language/format), safety (toxicity/nsfw_text/nsfw_image
  /celebrity_likeness/deepfake/copyrighted/pii_rescan/prompt_echo
  /watermark_verify/watermark_attach), verify (citation_coverage
  /factual_consistency/logical_consistency/constraint_satisfaction
  /tool_call_safety/numerical_check/source_link), eval
  (rubric_deterministic/rubric_llm_judge/pairwise/calibration
  /human_in_loop), augment (translate/simplify/tts/image_caption),
  memory (write_conversational/write_episodic/write_kb), cache
  (write_response/write_embedding), index.update_vector, escalate
  (human/different_model/different_pipeline), retry.with_critique,
  audit (trace/provenance/cost/compliance), report (markdown/pdf/html),
  deliver (streaming/email/webhook/queue/file).
- **cross_cutting**: chunk (fixed/semantic/recursive), embed
  (text/image/multimodal), parallel (fan_out/fan_in),
  loop.until_convergence, delay.backoff.

The list is OPEN. New `process_kind` values are added by PR with no
schema migration.

---

## 17. Processor artifact type

A **processor** is a typed, repeatable transformation with declared
I/O, side effects, and trust boundary. It is the generic slot for any
step in §16 that isn't already a `harness`, `tool`, or `rule-pack`.

Use a processor when the step is **not** a model call (use `harness`)
**and** is **not** a function-call definition a model invokes (use
`tool`) **and** is **not** a pure rule pack.

Examples: PDF-to-text converter, JSON repair, citation verifier,
fixed-token chunker, watermark attacher, cost-ceiling gate,
LLM-as-judge wrapper, memory store. The hub ships 14 sample processors
under `catalog/processors/` covering the major categories.

`tool` describes a function the *model* may decide to call. A processor
is invoked *by the pipeline runtime*, never by the model. Keeping the
two distinct makes auditability easier — a regulator can grep `type:
tool` to find anything the model can call, and `type: processor` to find
anything the pipeline runtime calls deterministically.

A processor that wraps an LLM call (e.g. `processor/llm-judge`)
declares `model_targets` exactly like a harness. The distinction is
that a processor is **anonymous to the model under review** — the judge
sits *outside* that model's reasoning trace.

Required fields: `process_kind`, `inputs[]`, `outputs[]`,
`side_effects`. Optional: `deterministic`, `idempotent`, `streaming`,
`latency_budget_ms`, `on_error`, `retry`, `model_targets`,
`implementations`. Full schema at `schemas/processor.schema.json`.

---

## 18. Standards alignment

The hub's YAML manifests are the source of truth, but every manifest is
**JSON-LD-addressable** and the hub **emits to the standards that matter
externally**. The full landscape analysis lives at
[`docs/research/standards-landscape.md`](../docs/research/standards-landscape.md);
this section binds the decisions.

### 18.1 JSON-LD context

`docs/ns/context.jsonld` is the canonical context. It maps hub terms to:

- **schema.org** core (`SoftwareApplication`, `Dataset`, `HowTo`,
  `CreativeWork`)
- **DCAT-3** (`dcat:Catalog`, `dcat:Dataset`, `dcat:Distribution`)
- **SKOS** for open vocabularies (`skos:ConceptScheme`)
- **PROV-O** for `attribution`/`provenance`
- **DPV** for privacy categories
- **SPDX** for license identifiers
- **ODRL** for non-trivial license / usage policies

A custom `ohh:` namespace covers concepts without prior art: `Harness`,
`Pipeline`, `Processor`, `lifecyclePosition`, `appliedLayer`,
`processKind`, etc.

### 18.2 Emit, don't replace

Renderers under `scripts/emit/` (planned) produce standards-conformant
outputs from the YAML manifests. Source of truth stays in `catalog/`.

| Target | Renderer | Source artifact |
|---|---|---|
| Croissant 1.0 (JSON-LD ML datasets) | `croissant.py` | `dataset`, `knowledge-pack` |
| MCP server stubs | `mcp_server.py` | `tool`, `processor` |
| MCP `tools/list` JSON-RPC | `mcp_tools_list.py` | hub-wide |
| Hugging Face Model Card | `hf_model_card.py` | `harness` |
| Hugging Face Dataset Card | `hf_dataset_card.py` | `dataset`, `knowledge-pack` |
| Hugging Face Space frontmatter | `hf_space.py` | `harness` (deploy) |
| lm-evaluation-harness YAML | `lm_eval_harness.py` | `benchmark` |
| promptfoo config | `promptfoo.py` | `benchmark` |
| CycloneDX-ML 1.6 AIBOM | `cyclonedx_ml.py` | release bundle |
| OpenLineage v2.0 events | `openlineage.py` | pipeline / benchmark run |
| C2PA v2.1 manifest | `c2pa.py` | image / audio / video output |
| EU AI Act Annex IV dossier | `eu_ai_act_annex_iv.py` | `eu_ai_act_risk: high_risk` |
| SPDX 3.0 (AI + Dataset profiles) | `spdx_3.py` | release bundle |
| OpenAI / Anthropic / Gemini tools | derived from MCP | `tool` |

Tool emitters are trivial renames over the canonical JSON Schema
`parameters` / `returns` fields; Gemini requires a JSON Schema →
OpenAPI 3.0-subset down-convert.

### 18.3 New envelope fields (additive)

```yaml
'@context': "/ns/context.jsonld"
'@id':      "https://open-harness-hub.dev/{type}/{slug}/{version}"
'@type':    ["SoftwareApplication", "ohh:Harness"]

eu_ai_act_risk: "minimal"
nist_ai_rmf_controls: ["GOVERN-1.1", "MAP-3.2"]
iso_42001_controls:   ["A.6.2.4"]

data_protection:                        # DPV-aligned
  data_categories: ["dpv:MedicalHealth"]
  hipaa_safe_harbor_categories: ["hsh:12", "hsh:14"]
  purposes:        ["dpv:ResearchAndDevelopment"]
  legal_basis:     ["dpv:LegitimateInterest"]
```

All fields are optional. Existing manifests stay valid.

### 18.4 Cite, don't restate

Authoritative external vocabularies are referenced by IRI rather than
re-published:

| Vocabulary | Canonical IRI pattern |
|---|---|
| ICD-10 | `http://id.who.int/icd/release/10/{code}` |
| SPDX licenses | `https://spdx.org/licenses/{id}.html` |
| ILO forced-labour indicators | `https://www.ilo.org/publications/...` |
| FATF typologies | FATF report URLs |
| MITRE ATT&CK | `https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/{id}/` |
| OFAC SDN | `https://sanctionssearch.ofac.treas.gov/Details.aspx?id={id}` |
| HIPAA Safe Harbor categories | `vocabularies/hipaa-safe-harbor.yaml` (`hsh:01`..`hsh:18`) |

### 18.5 Adoption phases

Phase 1 (in this commit):
- `/ns/context.jsonld` published.
- Envelope schema additions: `eu_ai_act_risk`,
  `nist_ai_rmf_controls`, `iso_42001_controls`, `data_protection`.
- HIPAA Safe Harbor controlled vocabulary at
  `vocabularies/hipaa-safe-harbor.yaml`.

Phase 2 (next): `scripts/emit/{croissant,mcp_server,hf_model_card}.py`.

Phase 3 (longer): `scripts/emit/{lm_eval_harness,promptfoo,cyclonedx_ml,openlineage,c2pa,eu_ai_act_annex_iv}.py`; hub-as-MCP server; DCAT + SKOS adoption.

### 18.6 What the hub deliberately does NOT adopt

- **Linked Data Platform** — too niche.
- **MLMD** — TFX-specific; superseded by MLflow + OpenLineage.
- **OpenAI Evals** — declining vs. lm-eval-harness.
- **HELM** as a direct emit target — mirror vocabulary instead.
- **Kaggle metadata** — platform-specific; renderer only when publishing.
