# ESG Disclosure Grading harness

Wraps the ESG supplier-policy-grading flow as a reusable harness
with persona + GREP + RAG + tools layers. Targets local-Ollama or
Anthropic/OpenAI for the judge model arm; emits citation-first
findings with CSDDD article + ILO indicator + national-law links.

## Applied layers

- `persona`
- `grep`
- `rag`
- `tools`

## supplier-pack → red flags → CSDDD citations → grade + remediation

*model_call:* `required`

**Steps**

1. structured-to-prose normalize
2. redact PII per HIPAA Safe Harbor + DPV
3. fire S+E+G GREP packs
4. RAG against CSDDD + corridors + lead-company code
5. judge against esg-supplier-compliance rubric
6. propose Art-10 remediation with milestones
7. emit audit trace per CSDDD Art-26

**Verification**

- every severity ≥ medium finding has ILO indicator + CSDDD article + national-law citations
- no PII in quoted grievance snippets
- CSDDD-Art.10 right-of-reply path proposed

## Privacy boundaries

- **raw_input**: stays local to the running pipeline
- **derived_output**: may sync to hub only after anonymization gate
- **external_calls**: only if model_target.trust_boundary == external AND user opted in

## Model targets

| id | transport | trust | required | default |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `local_ollama` | `ollama` | local | False | True |
| `anthropic_judge` | `anthropic` | external | False | False |
