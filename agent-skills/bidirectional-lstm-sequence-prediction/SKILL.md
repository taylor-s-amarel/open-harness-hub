# Bidirectional LSTM for sequence prediction (time-series / text)

Stacked Bidirectional LSTM for sequence-to-sequence or sequence-
to-label prediction. Standard Kaggle approach for: ventilator
pressure prediction, classic NLP toxic comment classification,
signal classification, EEG time-series. Often combined with 1D-CNN
for local feature extraction before recurrent layers.

## Task

Train stacked bidirectional LSTM (often + 1D-CNN front-end) for sequence-to-* tasks.

## Steps

1. **guard** — `rule_pack` → `rule-pack/grep-prompt-injection-heuristics`
2. **train** — `processor` → `processor/iterative-revise-loop`
3. **ensemble_folds** — `processor` → `processor/multi-vector-fusion`
4. **audit** — `processor` → `processor/audit-trace-emitter`

## Defaults

- **persona**: persona/research-analyst
