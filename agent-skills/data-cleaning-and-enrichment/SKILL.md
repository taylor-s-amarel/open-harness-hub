# Data cleaning + entity enrichment harness

Cross-vertical harness that normalizes a raw customer / vendor /
applicant record: addresses → USPS standardized + geocoded;
phones → E.164; names → canonical with given/family split;
countries → ISO 3166 codes; dates → ISO 8601; emails →
deliverable check; entities → linked to OpenCorporates /
Companies House. Output is a clean, enrichable record ready for
downstream pipelines (ESG / AML / claims / benefits / etc.).

Strictly local-first; external tool calls (USPS / Google Geocode /
OpenCorporates) opt-in via env-var keys.

## Applied layers

- `grep`
- `tools`

## raw record → standardized + enriched record

*model_call:* `optional`

**Steps**

1. parse address → USPS standardized + libpostal fallback
2. normalize phones → E.164 (libphonenumber)
3. canonicalize names → given_name + family_name + middle + suffix + honorific
4. resolve countries → ISO 3166 alpha-2/alpha-3/numeric
5. parse dates → ISO 8601
6. validate USPS deliverable (if US + tool/usps-address-validator configured)
7. geocode (if tool/google-geocode configured)
8. entity-link to OpenCorporates (if vendor / B2B record + tool/opencorporates-lookup configured)
9. validate SWIFT BIC (if payment / bank record)
10. compute dedup key for entity resolution

**Verification**

- every field has provenance (source step + confidence)
- no PII synthesis (e.g. don't FILL IN missing SSN)
- external-tool calls audited per record

## Privacy boundaries

- **raw_input**: stays local; external tool calls send sanitized fields only
- **derived_output**: may sync to hub only after anonymization gate
- **external_calls**: USPS / Google Geocode / OpenCorporates / SWIFT BIC — only when their env keys are set AND user opted in

## Model targets

| id | transport | trust | required | default |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `no_model` | `none` | local | False | True |
| `local_ollama_fallback` | `ollama` | local | False | False |
