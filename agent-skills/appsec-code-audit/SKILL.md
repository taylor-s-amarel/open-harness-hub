# AppSec Code Audit harness

CWE-cite-first AppSec audit harness for source-code review. Detects
secrets-in-code + injection + crypto/auth weaknesses + describes
attack vectors + proposes fixes.

## Applied layers

- `persona`
- `privacy`
- `grep`
- `rag`
- `tools`

## code bundle → secrets+vuln GREP → CWE/OWASP citations → grade + fixes

*model_call:* `required`

**Steps**

1. structured-to-prose
2. PII / secrets redact
3. code-vulnerabilities GREP (29 CWE-cited rules)
4. RAG against OWASP Top 10 LLM + MITRE ATT&CK
5. judge against code-security-review rubric
6. propose concrete fixes (parameterized query, version bump, alternative library)
7. audit trace

**Verification**

- every finding cites CWE-ID + OWASP category + CVE (if applicable)
- attack vector + impact described (no 'looks unsafe')
- concrete proposed fix provided
- code smells separated from real vulnerabilities

## Privacy boundaries

- **raw_input**: stays local; production secrets must be redacted upstream
- **derived_output**: may sync to hub only after anonymization gate
- **external_calls**: only if model_target.trust_boundary == external AND user opted in

## Model targets

| id | transport | trust | required | default |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `local_ollama` | `ollama` | local | False | True |
| `anthropic_judge` | `anthropic` | external | False | False |

## Provenance

- Hub artifact: `harness/appsec-code-audit` v0.1.0
- License: `MIT`
- Lifecycle: `beta`
