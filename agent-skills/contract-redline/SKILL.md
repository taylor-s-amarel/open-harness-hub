# Contract Clause Redlining harness

Playbook-cite-first harness for commercial contract review. Surfaces
red-flag clauses + proposes concrete redline language + cites the
playbook clause family for every finding.

## Applied layers

- `persona`
- `privacy`
- `grep`
- `rag`
- `tools`

## contract → red flags → playbook citations → redline proposals

*model_call:* `required`

**Steps**

1. structured-to-prose
2. PII redact
3. contract-red-flags GREP
4. RAG against contract-law-clauses playbook
5. judge against contract-review-quality rubric
6. emit suggested redline language per finding
7. audit trace

**Verification**

- every red-flag has redline + playbook citation + severity
- no PII / privileged content in output
- no definitive 'unenforceable' assertions

## Privacy boundaries

- **raw_input**: stays local; subject to attorney-client privilege
- **derived_output**: may sync to hub only with explicit privilege waiver
- **external_calls**: only if model_target.trust_boundary == external AND user opted in

## Model targets

| id | transport | trust | required | default |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `local_ollama` | `ollama` | local | False | True |
| `anthropic_opus` | `anthropic` | external | False | False |
