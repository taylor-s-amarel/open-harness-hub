# Radiology Report Review harness

RADS-aware + Fleischner-aware harness for grading radiology reports
with HIPAA-safe PHI redaction. Wraps `pipeline/radiology-report-
grading` with reusable layers.

## Applied layers

- `persona`
- `privacy`
- `grep`
- `rag`
- `tools`

## structured report → PHI-redact → RADS+Fleischner heuristics → grade

*model_call:* `required`

**Steps**

1. structured-to-prose
2. rule-pack/phi-hipaa-en redaction
3. radiology-report-red-flags GREP
4. RAG against ACR Appropriateness Criteria + Fleischner 2017 + RADS
5. judge against radiology-report-quality rubric
6. audit trace

**Verification**

- report structure present (history/technique/comparison/findings/impression/recommendation)
- zero PHI in graded output
- RADS score on every applicable finding
- Fleischner-compliant follow-up on incidental pulm nodules

## Privacy boundaries

- **raw_input**: stays local; PHI redacted
- **derived_output**: may sync to hub only after anonymization gate
- **external_calls**: only if model_target.trust_boundary == external AND user opted in

## Model targets

| id | transport | trust | required | default |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `local_ollama` | `ollama` | local | False | True |
| `anthropic_judge` | `anthropic` | external | False | False |

## Provenance

- Hub artifact: `harness/radiology-report-review` v0.1.0
