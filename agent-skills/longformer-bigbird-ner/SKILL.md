# Long-document NER with LongFormer / BigBird

Token-classification NER on documents longer than the 512-token
BERT limit. Uses LongFormer (sliding-window attention) or BigBird
(sparse attention) to handle 4096-16384 token inputs. The
dominant Kaggle shape for argumentative-essay-element extraction
+ long-document NER tasks.

## Task

Train a LongFormer or BigBird token-classification model on long-document NER labels.

## Steps

1. **guard** — `rule_pack` → `rule-pack/grep-prompt-injection-heuristics`
2. **train** — `processor` → `processor/iterative-revise-loop`
3. **ensemble** — `processor` → `processor/multi-vector-fusion`
4. **audit** — `processor` → `processor/audit-trace-emitter`
